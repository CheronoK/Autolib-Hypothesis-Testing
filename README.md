# Hypothesis-Testing
This repository contains week 4 independent project in which Hypothesis testing was required to be performed on data provided from a car sharing company.
# Data Analysis
I started by importing pandas library as it is essential in this analysis.
The provided data was loaded as a csv file.
The data was then accessed in order to figure out null values.
# Data Cleaning
Irrelevant columns were then removed
The columns with null values were also removed.
Removed all the spaces from the column names and replaced them with underscores. Also removed fullstops on the column names.
Changed the names of the columns to lower case to make work easier while writing code.
# Analysis
Univariate and Bivariate analysis was performed on the data
A sample was chosen from the data which was then used for the hypothesis testing.
